Softimage_MultiImporter
=======================


This addon was created as a test for using PyQt in Softimage. It essentially wraps native import commands into a single Qt interface, allowing you to import multple 3D formats at once.

Requires the [PyQtForSoftimage](https://github.com/caron/PyQtForSoftimage) addon.

For more information on using PyQt in Softimage, see [Installing PyQtForSoftimage](http://xsisupport.com/2014/01/07/installing-pyqtforsoftimage/).
